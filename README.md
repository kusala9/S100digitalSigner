# Keys and Certificates
The best reference for creation of keypairs for using the digital signer is S-100 Part 15 which contains commands for the popular openssl tool. This will allow you to create new key pairs and certificate signing requests. If you want test certificates please email me at jonathan.pritchard@iictechnologies.com.REMOVETHISFIRST and I can supply them using a dummy scheme administrator certificate. IN order to fill in the certificate signing request fields please refer to the S-100WG7 Paper  [here](https://iho.int/uploads/user/Services%20and%20Standards/S-100WG/S-100WG7/S100WG7-6.7_2022_EN_Part%2015%20Implementation.pdf)
